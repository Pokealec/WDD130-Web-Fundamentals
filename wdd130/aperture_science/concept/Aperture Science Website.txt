Our Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System (or GLaDOS for short), is our attempt at making a complete human-computer hybrid. Forget cyborgs and personality constructs- GLaDOS is based from the entirety of a human's conscience! That means she's got heart, soul, and an IQ of 9,023! (numbers may vary)
