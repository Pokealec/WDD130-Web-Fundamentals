About Aperture:
Our founder, Cave Johnson, believed that "Science isn't about why, it's about why not!" Cave built Aperture Science from the ground up, originally a shower curtain manufacturer for the military named Aperture Fixtures. By 1943 Aperture Fixtures was routinely earning the annual shower curtain salesman award, and in January 1944, Cave invested in a vast, decommissioned salt mine in Michigan, which later became Aperture Science Innovators in 1947. In that same year, Aperture Science Innovators received the Best New Science Company Award, granted to us by the Science and Business Institute of America. 

Aperture Fixtures has evolved over the course of half a century into an experimental physics research institution, which we lovingly call Aperture Science. We have been #2 on the Top 100 Applied Science Companies ranking since 1949, our only rival being Black Mesa.

We have a few various locations, but our main facility is the Aperture Science Enrichment Center, located in Upper Michigan.
