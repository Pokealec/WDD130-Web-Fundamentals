        Aperture Science, Inc. is a United States-based scientific research corporation appearing as the main antagonistic organization in Portal and Portal 2, as well as its logo on the Borealis in Half-Life 2: Episode Two.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main facility is the Aperture Science Enrichment Center, located in Upper Michigan, with at least one other base of operations in Cleveland, Ohio. Originally a shower curtain manufacturer named Aperture Fixtures, it evolved over the course of half a century into an experimental physics research institution and a bitter rival of Black Mesa.

        Colored paragraph example
      </h3>
      <p class="colored">
        Aperture Fixtures was founded in the late 1940s by Cave Johnson as a shower curtain manufacturer - the name "Aperture Fixtures" was chosen "to make the curtains appear more hygienic" - and by 1943 Cave's company was routinely earning the annual shower curtain salesman award. Using his newly accumulated funds, Cave invested in real estate and purchased a vast, decommissioned salt mine in Michigan in January 1944. Aperture Science Innovators was incorporated in 1947, receiving the Best New Science Company Award that same year, granted by the Science and Business Institute of America. Its long rivalry with Black Mesa started at the same time: Aperture was #2 on the Top 100 Applied Science Companies ranking for 1949, starting a pattern that would never be broken.

      <h3>About Aperture</h3>
      <p>
        "Science isn't about why, it's about why not?!" -Cave Johnson, Founder of Aperture Science
      </p>
      <p>
        Our founder, Cave Johnson, believed that "Science isn't about why, it's about why not!" Cave built Aperture Science from the ground up, originally a shower curtain manufacturer for the military named Aperture Fixtures. By 1943 Aperture Fixtures was routinely earning the annual shower curtain salesman award, and in January 1944, Cave invested in a vast, decommissioned salt mine in Michigan, which later became Aperture Science Innovators in 1947. In that same year, Aperture Science Innovators received the Best New Science Company Award, granted to us by the Science and Business Institute of America. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Aperture Fixtures has evolved over the course of half a century into an experimental physics research institution, which we lovingly call Aperture Science. We have been #2 on the Top 100 Applied Science Companies ranking since 1949, our only rival being Black Mesa.

        We have a few various locations, but our main facility is the Aperture Science Enrichment Center, located in Upper Michigan.
