            <h2>History of Aperture Science</h2>
            <p>Our founder, Cave Johnson, once said: <i>"They say great science is built on the shoulders of giants. Not here. At Aperture, we do all our science from scratch. No hand-holding."</i> (1952)</p>
            
            <p>Cave built Aperture Science from the ground up, originally as a shower curtain manufacturer for the military named "Aperture Fixtures." By 1943, Aperture Fixtures was routinely earning the annual shower curtain salesman award, and in January 1944, Cave invested in a vast, decommissioned salt mine in Michigan, which later became Aperture Science Innovators in 1947. In that same year, Aperture Science Innovators received the Best New Science Company Award, granted to us by the Science and Business Institute of America. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-info2">
            <p>Aperture Fixtures has evolved over the course of half a century into an experimental physics research institution, which we lovingly call Aperture Science. We have been #2 on the Top 100 Applied Science Companies ranking since 1949, our only rival being the heinous Black Mesa. </p>
                
            <p>We have a few various locations, but our main facility is the Aperture Science Enrichment Center, located in Upper Michigan. Our testing and research is mostly done underground, starting from that old salt mine and going up! </p>

            <p>We have a special suprise for those attending our first annual Bring Your Daughter to Work Day this year, and <i>she</i> can't wait to meet you!</p> <!--https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Hq2q09oF6Q-->
